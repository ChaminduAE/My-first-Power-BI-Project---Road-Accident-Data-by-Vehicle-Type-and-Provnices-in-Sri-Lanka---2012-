🚀 **Excited to Share My First Individual Power BI Project!** 🚀

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my first individual Power BI project, which explores Road Accident Data by Vehicle Type and Provinces in Sri Lanka for the year 2012. I sourced the dataset from Kaggle and utilized various tools and visualizations within Power BI to uncover insights.

### Key Features of the Project:

🔧 **Tools Used**:
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation, including data type checks, handling missing values, removing duplicates, splitting columns, and text transformations.
- **Power View**: For creating interactive visualizations.

📊 **Visualizations**:
- **Donut Chart**
- **Funnel Chart**
- **Stacked Area Chart**
- **Ribbon Chart**
- **Map**
- **Slicer**
- **Card**

📈 **Data Enhancements**:
- Created a new row for **Total Accidents** using the Table view option.
- Applied various measures such as **Average** to gain deeper insights.

🔍 **Data Preparation**:
- Thoroughly checked and transformed the dataset before diving into visualizations.

💡 **Insights and Findings**:
- Visualized road accident trends by vehicle type and provinces.
- Highlighted key patterns and anomalies within the data.

### Learnings and Experience:
This project was a fantastic learning experience. It gave me hands-on practice with data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in Power BI. I'm eager to apply these skills to more complex datasets and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
